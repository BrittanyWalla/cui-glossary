# Conversational Glossary of Terms

An open source glossary of terms used in conversational user interface design and development. 

The terms used within and emerging technology can become buzzwords and lose meaning. We wanted a core resource of understanding that we could use with our clients and the community. We made it open source because we know that the wisdom of the crowd can do powerful things to accelerate the growth of technology.

The terms were developed according to the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) (InterISO/IEC 11179â€“4)


The conversational glossary was developed Voxable. We aim to advance the design and development of conversational interfaces by sharing resources with the community.
